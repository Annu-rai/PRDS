              <h3>HOLY COW PROJECT</h3>
              <p class="holycontent">
                For decades, the women are suffering from male dominance in spite of the fact that they are rendering their best services in the household works and also in the field of agriculture.  However, the work of women is not treated equal to men, and they are paid less wages when compared to their male counterparts.  Added to this, they have other problems like social insecurity.  If the male members of their families move away from the villages in search of wage employment, they have to suffer not only with the economic problems, but also with other issues like social insecurity, and mental agony of being unprotected or under-protected. 
              </p>
<p class="holycontent">The HOLY COW PROJECT focusses on creating an opportunity for sustainable income through Off-Farm Activity, which is well known to the women in this area.  </p>

<p class="holycontent">The project identifies women members belonging to the economically poor families and form them into a group.  This project is implemented in phases, covering a limited number of members in each phase. </p>
 
              </div>
         


            <div class="container">
                <div class="holy_paragraph">
            <p>
            In the first phase 10 most vulnerable families / women who need to be supported in the First Phase.  This selection will be done by the members by themselves.  PRDS will Facilitate the meeting for smooth and fair selection.  The project continues support new families   / women every month by giving the repayment amounts to another women / family who is already identified by the group and is waiting for her turn. </p>


          <span> <h6 class="selection">Selection of beneficiaries during the First Phase:</strong></h6>The group will be having equal number of representation from different socially and economically downward communities/ families. It will have:</span>

        
          <ul>
<li>
 Three (3) women members from Scheduled castes;
 </li>

<li> Three (3) women and from backward castes; and</li>

<li> Three (3) women and from other groups</li>


<li> One member will be selected from any of these groups basing on the povertied condition, and need of the situation. 
    This <br>selection will be done by the members only among theselves.</li>

        </ul>
      </div>
      <h6 class="selection">The group formed with these women will be named after Fransesco Tamma</h6>
        
   <span><h6 class="selection">The Proposed activity:</h6>
      <p>Each woman of this group will be given a milch animal (the cow). Due to fairly good rains for the past 3 years, there is adequate fodder, and drinking water available for the animals in this area – around the village.</p>
 <p>Each cow is expected to give around 10 to 15 liters of milk per day (morning and evening).  There is a big demand for milk in this area, as there are several hotels and other such business establishments around this village – the big marketing places will be Puttaparthi and Kothacheruvu, which are the mandal headquarters with a lot of households, Tea-stalls and other such shops where milk and milk-products are sold. </p></span>

 <p>The present market price of is around Rs.27/- per liters.  Thus, they will be able to make an income of Rs.270/- to Rs.400/- per day.  Thus, there will be an assure income of Rs.8000/- to Rs.12,000/-. This will, certainly, elevate the financial position of women. The financially independent women are given respect everywhere in the society. This will help women also to be empowered as men and also in supporting their family income.</p>

                <p>It is a traditional belief that Cow is as propitious as our mother. In our society most of us provide Cow milk for babies instead of breast feeding. Infants consuming cow milk are active, strong, and free from diseases. Cow milk has all the proteins like mother’s milk. Cow milk is healthy for all the ages of human beings and easily digestible. Cow milk also keeps the human body in balance. In temples also the priests perform abhisheka with milk to the idols. Many of us strongly believe that it is good to light lamps with cow ghee while worshipping God. Eatables prepared with cow ghee are tasty and healthy. By consuming cow ghee our body will become strong, mind will become sharp, and we get innovative ideas. We have strong faith if a cow is in front of our house that everything good will happen to the family. During housewarming the cow is made to enter the house first. During the time of marriage cows are given as gift to the daughters. Cow is the mother that bestows all auspiciousness. Cow is called kamadhenu as it fulfils our desires. Worshipping the cow with turmeric and saffron powder is a daily ritual in India. That is how a cow is considered unique.</p>

                <h3>SIGNIFICANCE OF COW IN THE INDIAN TRADITION / FAMILIES</h3>
                <p>Farmer couples involved in Dairy project wake up early in the morning, pray to god, bow down to Mother Earth and start their daily routine work. They go to the Gokulam where the cows are taking rest. They move the cows and clean up the entire Gokulam. Then they extract milk from the cows and take the milk to the Diary. Ladies bathe the cows while gents go to the fields and bring green grass to feed the cows.</p>

                <p>Generally, the women folk wake up early, get ready, clean the premises in front of their house with liquid cow dung and put rangoli designs on it. They also decorate the rangolis by sprinkling flower petals which look attractive and traditional. They also keep small balls of cow dung and place an oil lamp and ignite incense sticks. They worship the cow, apply turmeric and vermilion on the forehead of the cows and pray with great devotion. After that for some time they tie up the cow outside for an exposure to sunlight.</p>
           
           <p> In addition to green grass, farmers also provide some nutritional foods like powder husk/rice bran powder mixed with water to the cows.  They extend their valuable services to the cows throughout the day. In the evening also they extract milk and supply to the dairies. Farmers are always with cow, keep them clean and extend their valuable day to day services to the cows. To protect the cows from mosquitoes, flies and other harmful insects they tie a stem of Aloevera and neem leaves in the Gokulam. They burn Benzoin (Sambrani) powder in the Gokulam which they believe to be good and auspicious for the cows. They believe that by doing so no evil can come near the cows.</p>
<p>They treat cow as a goddess and worship daily. They provide grass to the cows during the night also. They treat the cows with more care than their own children. They treat the cow as a cherished animal and worship. They believe if cow is in front of the house, they feel that a goddess is in front of their house. There are so many advantages by running a dairy. </p>
